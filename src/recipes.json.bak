Legend says chancellor Zhuge Liang invented it to feed his soldiers who had lost their woks. The Tianjin style became famous and was first documented in a newspaper in 1933. Jianbing Guozi is a popular breakfast street food. The Tianjin style is famous for its use of mung bean flour for a softer crepe and is typically filled with youtiao (fried dough sticks), whereas the original Shandong version uses crispier crackers. In 2017, the skill of making Tianjin Jianbing Guozi was listed as a municipal intangible cultural heritage.",
